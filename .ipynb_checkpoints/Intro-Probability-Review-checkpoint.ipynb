    "A **random variable** is set of possible values that come from some random phenomenon. A **discrete random variable** takes on a countable number of distinct values such as the number of heads found in $n$ trials. A **continuous random variable** can take on an infinite number of values in an interval such as the weight of a subject.\n",

    "The **probability mass function (PMF)** ($P(X=x)$) is the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. We refer to the support of a probability mass function as the set of values that the discrete random variable takes on.\n",

    "Some properties of the PMF of a random variable include:\n",
    " - $P(X=x) \\geq 0$\n",

    "The **probability density function (PDF)** ($f(x)$) is the probability that a continuous random variable takes on a specific range.\n",
