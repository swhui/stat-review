    "A **random variable** is set of possible values that come from some random phenomenon. A **discrete random variable** takes on a countable number of distinct values such as the number of heads found in $n$ trials. A **continuous random variable** can take on an infinite number of values in an interval such as the weight of a subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **probability mass function (PMF)** ($P(X=x)$) is the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. We refer to the support of a probability mass function as the set of values that the discrete random variable takes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties of the PMF of a random variable include:\n",
    " - $P(X=x) \\geq 0$\n",
    " - $\\sum_{\\text{all }x} P(X=x) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **probability density function (PDF)** ($f(x)$) is the probability that a continuous random variable takes on a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, some properties of the PDF of a random variable include:\n",
    " - $f(x) \\geq 0$\n",
    " - $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of a random variable, $X$ is defined to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{X}(x) = P(X \\leq x); \\thinspace x\\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties of the **CDF** of a random variable include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow -\\infty} F(x) = 0$\n",
    " - $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} F(x) = 1$\n",
    " - CDF is non-decreasing (if $x \\leq y$, then $F(x) \\leq F(y)$) and right-continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **expectation of a discrete random variable** $X$ with probability mass function ($P(X=x)$) is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\sum_{\\text{all x}} x P(X=x)$$\n",

    "The **expectation of a continuous random variable** $X$ with probability density function ($f(x)$) is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\int_{\\text{all x}} x f(x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **variance of a random variable** $X$ is the expectation of the squared deviation of the random variable from its mean.\n",
