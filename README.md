# Review of Statistics

This repository contains an aggregation of notes and exercises which review probability and statistical concepts. 

A lot of these notes and exercises come from when I was taking the course back in Spring 2019. Hopefully, these notes will serve as a good review/refresher for those who are taking or completed the course (and myself). I would read them in the following order: 

1. Intro-Probability-Review 
2. Parameter Estimation 
3. Method of Moments and Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
4. Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing 
5. More on Hypothesis Testing 
6. Simple Linear Regression 
7. Linear Algebra and Linear Regression
