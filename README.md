# Review of Statistics

This repository contains an aggregation of notes and exercises which review probability and statistical concepts. 

A lot of these notes and exercises come from when I was taking the course back in Spring 2019. Hopefully, these notes will serve as a good review/refresher for those who are taking or completed the course (and myself).
