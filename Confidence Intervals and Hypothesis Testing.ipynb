    "A **confidence interval** for a population parameter, call it $\\theta$, is a random interval, constructed from the sample, that will contain $\\theta$ with some probability. If we took many random samples and created $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence intervals from each random sample, $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ of these random variables would contain the parameter of interest. We can also interpret this as follows: a $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\theta$ is a random interval that contains the parameter of interest with probability $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$. A confidence interval is a range of values that provide information about the amount of uncertainty we have about our sample estimate.\n",
